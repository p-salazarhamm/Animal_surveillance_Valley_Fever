* Species of *Coccidioides* were detected in 12% (24/199) of samples using ITS2 amplicon sequencing.
* *Coccidioides* was present in a diverse number of hosts (14 mammalian species) adding nine new species of wild mammals. However, there does not appear to be one sole dominant host.
* *Coccidioides* appeared to be commensal and in low relative abundance and its presence didn't disrupt the normal lung mycobiome.

* Five cases of coccidioidomycosis in animals that were acquired within Washington, USA, that have not traveled outside of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, regardless of the amount of time between travel and onset of disease.

* Of >7,000 mammals stranding along the California coast, 36 had coccidioidomycosis (15 sea lions, 20 sea otters, and one harbor seal)
* Species of *Coccidioides* is the most common pathogen causing systemic mycosis in marine mammals in central California

* By testing the serum from 40-trapped rodents with ELISA, antibodies against *Coccidioides* was detected in three samples from two rodent species: *Peromyscus maniculatus* and *Neotoma lepida*. 
* A nested PCR of the ITS2 rDNA region using nearby soil samples recovered *Coccidioides* from 15 out of 24 (62.5%) samples.

* *Coccidioides posadasii* was recovered from *Carollia perspicillata* bat lungs in northeast Brazil.
* Immunologic studies detected coccidioidal antibodies and antigens in *Glossophaga soricina* and *Desmodus rotundus* bats.
