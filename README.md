# mammal_lung_mycobiome
Employing ultra-frozen lung tissues from biorepositories, we obtained Illumina fungal ribosomal DNA ITS2 sequences from 199 small mammals across 39 species. Using the following pipeline for community analyses, we documented diverse fungi, including common environmental fungi such as *Penicillium* and *Aspergillus*, associates of the human mycobiome such as *Malassezia* and *Candida*, and others specifically adapted for lungs (*Coccidioides*, *Blastomyces*, and *Pneumocystis*).
