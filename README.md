* Species of *Coccidioides* were detected in 12% (24/199) of samples using ITS2 amplicon sequencing.
* *Coccidioides* wass present in a diverse number of hosts (14 mammalian species) adding nine new species of wild mammals. However, there does not appear to be one sole dominant host.
* *Coccidioides* appeared to be commensal and in low relative abundance and its presence didn't disrupt the normal lung mycobiome.
