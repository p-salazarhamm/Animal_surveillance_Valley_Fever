# mammal_lung_mycobiome
Employing ultra-frozen lung tissues from biorepositories, we obtained fungal ribosomal DNA ITS2 sequences from 199 small mammals across 39 species. Using the following pipeline for community analyses, we documented diverse fungi, including common environmental fungi such as Penicillium and Aspergillus, associates of the human mycobiome such as Malassezia and Candida, and others specifically adapted for lungs (Coccidioides, Blastomyces, and Pneumocystis).
