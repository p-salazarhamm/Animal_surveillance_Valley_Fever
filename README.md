* *Coccidioides* was detected in all samples from north of Mesa, Arizona (n=14) and five (19%) from southeast of Tucson, Arizona.
* CocciDx detected *Coccidioides* in more samples than the ITS2 amplicon sequencing.

* Species of *Coccidioides* were detected in 12% (24/199) of samples using ITS2 amplicon sequencing.
* *Coccidioides* was present in a diverse number of hosts (14 mammalian species) adding nine new species of wild mammals. However, there does not appear to be one sole dominant host.
* *Coccidioides* appeared to be commensal and in low relative abundance and its presence didn't disrupt the normal lung mycobiome.

* By testing the serum from 40-trapped rodents with ELISA, antibodies against *Coccidioides* was detected in three samples from two rodent species: *Peromyscus maniculatus* and *Neotoma lepida*. 
* A nested PCR of the ITS2 rDNA region using nearby soil samples recovered *Coccidioides* from 15 out of 24 (62.5%) samples.
